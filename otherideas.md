Yeah, there are a few ways to approach it and they have pretty different tradeoffs. Let me think through them:

**Option 1: Library/SDK (you write the host)**

You'd publish something like `npm install rivet-core` and it gives you a YAML parser + runtime engine. A developer writes a minimal host app:

```js
import { Rivet } from 'rivet-core'
const bot = await Rivet.load('./bolt.yaml')
bot.start()
```

This is the most flexible — people can embed it in their own Node app, extend it with custom action types, swap out the storage backend, etc. But it still requires someone 
to set up a project, install dependencies, handle hosting. It's a developer tool, not an end-user tool.

**Option 2: Standalone CLI runtime (like Docker or Terraform)**

You install a single binary or global CLI:

```bash
npx rivet run ./my-bot/
# or
rivet run ./my-bot/ --env .env
rivet validate ./my-bot/
rivet dev ./my-bot/ --hot-reload
```

The runtime IS the product. You don't write any code around it. You just write YAML files and point the runtime at them. This is closer to how Terraform or Docker Compose 
works — the config is the program, the CLI is the engine. This feels like the right default for the spec's philosophy. You'd also get commands like `rivet init` to scaffold 
a new bot, `rivet add moderation` to drop in a builtin, `rivet export` to dump the generated slash command registrations.

**Option 3: Hosted platform (like Vercel for bots)**

You push your YAML to a service and it runs it:

```bash
rivet deploy ./my-bot/ --region us-west
```

Or even just a web UI where you paste/upload your YAML. This is the "Botstack but open" play. Maximum accessibility, zero infrastructure knowledge needed, but now you're 
running a platform, not just shipping a tool.

---

Realistically, you'd build them in order — **Option 2 first, Option 1 falls out of it naturally, Option 3 is the stretch goal.** Here's how I'd actually structure it:

**The core architecture would be:**

```

**The key insight is that the parser turns YAML into an intermediate representation** — basically a graph of nodes. Each event handler becomes a chain of action nodes. Each 
flow is a callable subgraph. The runtime walks the graph when events fire. This is exactly like how LATCH works conceptually — the YAML is just a serialization format for a 
flow graph.

The **expression evaluator** is the trickiest part. You need something sandboxed that can access context objects but can't do arbitrary code execution. You'd probably build 
a small interpreter or use something like `expr-eval` but extended with your context objects and built-in functions. Not a full JS eval — a constrained expression language.

**For the action system**, each action type registers itself:

```ts
// pseudocode
registry.register('send_message', {
  schema: { channel: 'string', content: 'string', embed: 'object?' },
  execute: async (ctx, params) => {
    const channel = await ctx.resolveChannel(params.channel)
    const content = ctx.evaluate(params.content)
    return await ctx.discord.sendMessage(channel.id, { content, ... })
  }
})
```

So adding new action types is just registering new handlers. Third parties could publish action plugins.

**Builtins are just YAML that gets merged.** When you write `builtins: { moderation: { enabled: true } }`, the runtime loads `builtins/moderation/definition.yaml` which 
contains the full command/event/state/flow definitions, templated with your config values. It's turtles all the way down — builtins are BOLT specs themselves.

**The development flow would be:**

```bash
# scaffold
rivet init my-bot
# edit YAML
# run with hot reload
rivet dev ./my-bot/
# validate
rivet validate ./my-bot/
# run for real
rivet run ./my-bot/
```

For the voice/audio stuff, you'd lean on existing libraries — `@discordjs/voice`, `@discordjs/opus`, `prism-media` for FFmpeg integration. The YAML just declares what to 
play; the runtime wires up the actual audio pipeline.

The whole thing is probably TypeScript/Node given that discord.js is the most mature ecosystem for this. Though a Rust or Go runtime would be interesting for performance 
(and a single binary distribution without needing Node installed).

**What would actually take the most work**, in order:
1. The expression evaluator (getting it right, safe, and fast)
2. The action system (there are a LOT of actions to implement)
3. Voice/audio pipeline
4. The builtins (each one is basically a mini-bot worth of logic)
5. The dashboard
6. Pipe adapters

The parser and CLI are comparatively straightforward. The core runtime loop (event comes in → match handlers → evaluate conditions → execute action chains) isn't that 
complex once the pieces exist.

Does this track with what you were imagining? And are you thinking about this as something you'd actually build, or more as a spec to put out there and see if it gains 
traction?
